### Extract technical contradictions with full TRIZ analysis (returns TechnicalContradiction objects with UUIDs, parameters, and principles)
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/contradictions/extract-tc
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "We need to make the car lighter to improve fuel efficiency, but lighter materials are more expensive and may compromise safety."
}

### Extract contradictions with limited parameters (more precise analysis)
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/contradictions/extract-tc?limit=1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "To increase the strength of the material, we need to add more reinforcement fibers, but this makes it heavier and more expensive."
}

### Extract contradictions with more parameters (broader analysis)
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/contradictions/extract-tc?limit=5
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Making the surface smoother reduces friction and improves efficiency, but it becomes more difficult to grip and handle safely."
}

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "To increase the strength of the material, we need to add more reinforcement fibers, but this makes it heavier and more expensive. Additionally, making the surface smoother reduces friction and improves efficiency, but it becomes more difficult to grip and handle safely."

### Extract contradictions from patent content (with default parameters)
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/patents/extract
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Lightweight Composite Material with Enhanced Strength Properties",
  "abstract": "A novel composite material comprising carbon fibers and polymer matrix providing superior strength-to-weight ratio for aerospace applications.",
  "description": "The present invention relates to composite materials for structural applications. The material combines carbon fiber reinforcement with a thermoplastic polymer matrix. While the addition of carbon fibers significantly increases tensile strength and stiffness, it also increases manufacturing complexity and material cost. The lightweight design improves fuel efficiency in aerospace applications, but the reduced thickness may compromise impact resistance under certain loading conditions."

### Classify patent solutions to TRIZ principles (default: top 10)
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/patents/classify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Self-Healing Smart Material System",
  "abstract": "An intelligent material system that automatically detects and repairs micro-cracks using embedded healing agents and shape memory alloys.",
  "description": "The invention provides a smart material system incorporating shape memory alloy wires and encapsulated healing agents. When damage occurs, the system activates healing mechanisms autonomously. The self-healing capability extends component lifetime and reduces maintenance requirements, but increases initial material complexity and cost. The embedded sensors provide real-time damage monitoring, yet add weight and potential failure points to the system."
