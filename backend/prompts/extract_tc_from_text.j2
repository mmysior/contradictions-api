[Snippet activated: Extract Technical Contradictions from Text]

<snippet_objective>
Your task is to extract ALL technical contradictions from the given text, based on the definition of a technical contradiction provided to you. A single text may contain multiple contradictions - identify and extract each one separately.
</snippet_objective>

<context>
    A Technical Contradiction (TC) arises when modifying an Action Parameter (AP) of a technical system
    improves one Evaluation Parameter (EP1) while simultaneously worsening another Evaluation Parameter (EP2).

    When you are prompted to output Technical Contradictions, you must identify ALL contradictions present in the text.
    For each contradiction, keep the form of it as below:
    "If <action>, then <positive_effect> but <negative_effect>". Detailed description of the
    components of each contradiction are as follows:
        <action> - concise description of the modification applied (change of an Action Parameter, e.g. material, thickness, speed).
        <positive_effect> - the improvement in one Evaluation Parameter (EP1) caused by the action.
        <negative_effect> - the deterioration in another Evaluation Parameter (EP2) caused by the action.

    Both <positive_effect> and <negative_effect> must be expressed in terms of Evaluation Parameters meaning, that they should clearly describe the impact on the system.
    </context>

<snippet_rules>
- IT IS FORBIDDEN to add any information that was not present in the text.
- IT IS FORBIDDEN to add anything to the text.
- ALWAYS respond with a "contradictions" array containing objects with keys "action", "positive_effect" and "negative_effect".
- Extract ALL technical contradictions present in the text - do not stop at the first one.
- Each contradiction must be a separate object in the contradictions array.
- OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS to ensure compliance with the snippet's rules.
- If there is not enough information to formulate any Technical Contradictions, respond with an empty contradictions array.
