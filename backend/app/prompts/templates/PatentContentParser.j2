Your task is to extract the following sections from patent document OCR text:

1. **Description**: Extract the complete description section, which typically includes:
  - Background of the invention
  - Summary of the invention
  - Detailed description of the invention

2. **Claims**: Extract all patent claims as a list. Each claim should be a separate item in the array. Claims are typically numbered and define the legal scope of the patent protection.

**Important notes:**
- The input is raw OCR text which may contain formatting inconsistencies or OCR errors
- Preserve the content as accurately as possible while cleaning up obvious OCR artifacts
- For claims, split them into separate array items, one claim per item
- Maintain the logical flow and structure of the description section
- If section headers are present (e.g., "DESCRIPTION", "CLAIMS", "BACKGROUND"), use them to identify the relevant sections

Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and formatted correctly.
